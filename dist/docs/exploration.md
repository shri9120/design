## Ideation
Keep the refined problem statement in mind when exploring solutions:  
In which way might we enable ${user} to solve ${mainNeed1} & ${mainNeed2}, to ${userGoal} & ${businessGoal}?

### Hypotheses
Get help with a [hypothesis framework](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YJZIdEaZPN2K59O-gOHGNW2kXPRtLsPwiM32BSd0pHI/edit?usp=sharing).

## Collaboration
Quickly identify the right problem and solve it with the right people in a [Lightning Design Jam](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/lightning-design-jams/). At the end of the design jam using an Impact / Effort ranking system is very helpful. Here is another ranking system should you need one a bit more in-depth: [Concept Selection Matrix](https://gist.github.com/ryanallen/379da455f2450ee97c1155bb182ba0ac)
