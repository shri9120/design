## Project tracking
Ensure each project begins with a kickoff meeting, wherein stakeholders and cross-functional team leads come together to synchronize the various users, issues, schedules, and anticipated outcomes.

---
### Team
Define who will be working on this project and what will they be doing.  

| Name | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
  
---
### Roadmap  
| Project name + Work ticket link | Due date |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
  
---

### Measurements
| Name | Current state | Desired state |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

---

## Audits  
Review the current state as well as competitorsâ€™ current states to inform the future state. Keep track Artifacts in the [Exploration](/dist/docs/exploration.md) --> Artifacts table below.  

---
## Users + Needs
Identify and survey end users, business stakeholders, and subject matter experts to get their problems which will be refined into needs. Use the tables below or this [version in google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11jehH_a7HNAwWOaf_5W3wolRz1lOSHGhhyUC2JtG8fc/edit?usp=sharing) to track and prioritize them.
  
---
### Users raw & encoded needs
Scope your users' needs/problems [like this](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/falling-wrong-design-problem/) to find the root instead of solving symptoms of a deeper problem.
| User | Time/date | Verbatim | Encoded needs like [1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ici0tedx4cje718/encodingRule1.png), [2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2bo8ch7yvukqico/encodingRule2.png), & [3](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fn726cp2gjrsy91/encodingRule3%2B4.png) |

### Sorted needs
| ${mainNeed1} | ${mainNeed2} |
| --- | --- |
| **Subneed 1.1** | **Subneed 2.1** |
| Individual need 1.1.1 | Individual need 2.1.1 |
| Individual need 1.1.2 | Individual need 2.1.2 |
| **Subneed 1.2** | **Subneed 2.2** |
| Individual need 1.2.1 | Individual need 2.2.1 |
  
---
### Refined problem statement  
In which way might we enable ${user} to solve ${mainNeed1} & ${mainNeed2}, to ${userGoal} & ${businessGoal}?
